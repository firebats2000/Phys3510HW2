# Assignment — Python in Google Colab (Intro)

In this repo you’ll find a Colab notebook to guide you through some basics of Python and the Colab environment.

---

## Getting Started

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:  
   - Go to the `.ipynb` file in this repo and choose **"Open in Colab"**.

2. Follow the instructions inside the notebook.  
   - You’ll alternate between **Markdown cells** (notes/exercises) and **Code cells** (Python).  
   - Run cells with **Shift+Enter**.

## Saving Your Work

- As you complete the notebook, make sure to **save/commit** your changes back to this GitHub repo.  
- From Colab:  
  - Go to **File → Save a copy in GitHub**  
  - Select your assignment repo  
  - Commit with a short message like `"complete exercise 3"`  

Remember, each commit is a checkpoint you can return to.

## Deliverables

- Work through **all exercises in the notebook**.  
- Ensure your answers/code run top-to-bottom without errors.  
- Commit the updated `.ipynb` file before the deadline.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If something doesn’t work, try:
  1. Restarting the runtime (**Runtime → Restart session**)  
  2. Running all cells from the top  
  3. Checking the traceback for the error type and message
